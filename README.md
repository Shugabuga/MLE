## Self-hosted

[The latest non-dev version can be found here.](http://sebadorn.de/mlp/mle/)


## ToDo

* `[Feature]` Search for list names
* `[Feature]` Search for emote names
* `[Feature]` Add easy way to use modifiers (-combine, -i, -in, -r, -shift, -slide, -spin)
* `[Feature]` Add option for a context menu per browser API (not HTML, but actually extending it)
* `[Feature]` Options to style context menu
* `[Feature]` Make it a toolbar button
* `[Feature]` MLE ctx menu active inside the BPM emote search
* `[Bug]` Context menu being positioned partly out of view
* `[Bug]` Context sub menu taking its time on first opening
* `[Bug]` Emote count of a list doesn't update when adding an emote (only after a page reload)
* `[Bug]` In some cases it seems the normal Chrome context menu isn't prevented from opening and covers the MLE ctx menu


## Done

* `[Feature]` Make it just a little button next to the textarea(s)
* `[Bug]` Clicking the mail symbol opens the MLE ctx menu, which it shouldn't
* `[Bug]` Moving a list doesn't work (duplicates list, for example "Pinkie Pie" -> "Pinkie_Pie", but doesn't even persist)
* `[Bug]` Config changes not saved every time (use "save" button instead?)
* `[Bug]` Renaming a list per right-click doesn't work on the whole area.
