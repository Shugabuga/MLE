## ToDo

* `[Feature]` Search for list names
* `[Feature]` Search for emote names
* `[Feature]` Add easy way to use modifiers (-combine, -i, -in, -r, -shift, -slide, -spin)
* `[Feature]` Add option for a context menu per browser API (not HTML, but actually extending it)
* `[Feature]` Options to style context menu
* `[Bug]` Context menu being positioned partly out of view
* `[Bug]` Context sub menu taking its time on first opening
* `[Bug]` Emote count of a list doesn't update when adding an emote (only after a page reload)
* `[Bug]` Config changes not saved every time (use "save" button instead?)
