## ToDo

* `[Feature]` Option to change the "insert reverse" modifier key
* `[Bug]` Context sub menu taking its time on first opening
* `[Bug]` Quotation marks for list names are bad and break things. There is a reeeaaally weird bug, where a variable suddenly becomes unusable and I have no idea what's going on. Seriously. Do yourself a favor and don't use quotation marks for the time being.
